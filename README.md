## Yes! Here I am

My name is Lucas Perry and I'm a recent graduate from the *University of Washington* with a degree in Computer Science and Systems. I am interested in building reliable software, learning from experienced engineers, and contributing effectively as part of a team.

I value clear communication, thoughtful design, and practical solutions to real problems.
